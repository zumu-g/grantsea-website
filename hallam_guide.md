## A brief history
Hallam's history reflects the broader industrial development of Melbourne's southeast. Originally part of the Dandenong district, the area remained largely rural until the post-war period when industrial development began transforming the landscape.

The opening of Hallam railway station in 1901, though the area remained sparsely populated for decades afterward, provided the foundation for future growth. Significant residential development occurred from the 1970s onwards as workers in nearby industrial areas sought affordable family homes, leading to the establishment of schools, shops, and community facilities.

The suburb was named after John Hallam, a early colonist and member of Victoria's Legislative Council.
