## üêõ Known Issues

1. **Lockfile Warning** - Non-critical warning about SWC dependencies
2. **Property Navigation** - Still needs to be fixed (from previous session)
3. **Careers Page Title** - Changed from "Grant's" to "Grants" to avoid apostrophe issues

## üé® Design Decisions

- Followed minimalist design principles throughout
- Used lots of white space for premium feel
- Consistent typography (300-400 font weights)
- Black and white color scheme
- Bottom-border-only form inputs
- Hover effects on all interactive elements

## üìù Next Steps

1. **Fix property navigation issue** - Critical functionality
2. **Create /rent page** - Missing core page
3. **Create /sell page** - Missing core page  
4. **Add map integration** - For office locations and property search
5. **Implement user authentication** - For saved properties and searches
6. **Add property comparison feature**
7. **Create agent individual pages** - Link from team page

## üîß Technical Notes

- All new pages use external CSS files (no styled-jsx)
- Careers page is a client component due to form state
- Form submissions currently log to console (ready for API integration)
- All pages are responsive with proper breakpoints
- Consistent container padding across all pages

## üö® Important Reminders

1. When creating new pages with "use client", don't export metadata
2. Avoid using apostrophes in string literals - use escaped versions
3. Always test responsive design at multiple breakpoints
4. Maintain consistent padding (On.com match): 48px desktop, 32px tablet, 16px mobile
