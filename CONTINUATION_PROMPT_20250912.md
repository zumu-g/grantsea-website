# Continuation Prompt - Grant's Estate Agents Website

## Project Context
You are continuing work on the Grant's Estate Agents (GEA) website, a modern real estate platform for Melbourne's South East. The project uses Next.js 13.5, React 18, TypeScript, and integrates with VaultRE CRM API.

## Current State (September 12, 2025)
The website has been significantly enhanced with ON.com-inspired design patterns. Recent work includes:
- Enhanced saved properties with premium minimalist design
- Comprehensive Berwick suburb guide integration
- New rental properties page with weekly pricing
- Fixed buy page to only show sale properties
- Draft sell page (needs syntax fix)

## Immediate Tasks to Complete

### 1. Fix Sell Page Syntax Issue üö®
The sell page (`/src/app/sell/page.tsx`) has a React Fragment syntax error preventing compilation. The page has been created with comprehensive content but won't build due to `<>` fragment syntax issues.

Quick fix:
```bash
# Replace <> with <div> and </> with </div>
# Or investigate why React Fragments are failing in this specific file
```

The page includes:
- Hero section with appraisal CTA
- Why Choose Us section
- 6-step selling process
- Success stories
- Premium marketing package details
- Appraisal modal form

All content is ready - just needs the syntax issue resolved.

### 2. Complete Remaining Suburb Guides üìç
Create comprehensive guides for:
- **Clyde North** - Use existing `clyde_north_guide.md` if found
- **Cranbourne** - Major regional center
- **Officer** - Growing family suburb  
- **Pakenham** - Outer growth area

Each guide should follow the Berwick pattern with sections for:
- Introduction and overview
- Location & Transport
- Lifestyle & Amenities
- Schools & Education
- Housing & Market
- Community & Culture
- Current Listings
- Tips for Buyers

### 3. Fix Pre-commit Style Validation üîß
The style validation hook is checking for ON.com shop categories which aren't relevant for a real estate site. Either:
- Update the validation script to remove shop category checks
- Add real estate-specific validations
- Or disable the problematic checks

## Design Standards to Maintain
