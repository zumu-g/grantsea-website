# Grant's Estate Agents Website - Handover Prompt for New Session

## Context
You're working on a Next.js 13 real estate website for Grant's Estate Agents in Melbourne, Australia. The site integrates with VaultRE CRM API for property data and is styled using a combination of Anima design exports and custom styling to match on.com's modern aesthetic.

## Critical Issue to Fix
**Property navigation is completely broken** - when users click on property cards in the listings or search pages, nothing happens. They cannot navigate to individual property detail pages (`/property/[id]`). This is the #1 priority.

### What's Been Tried
- Changed from Next.js `<Link>` to `<div>` with onClick
- Implemented both `router.push()` and `window.location.href`
- Added stopPropagation to save buttons
- Created test pages and debug panel
- Verified routes exist and API methods work

### Debug Tools in Place
There's a yellow debug panel on `/listings` with test buttons to help diagnose:
- Test navigation to `/property/test`
- Test different navigation methods
- Shows first property ID from API

**First step**: Run the site, open browser console, click the debug buttons and property cards to see what errors appear.

## Recent Changes Made
1. **Search page** - Completely redesigned to match on.com style with slide-out filter panel from left
2. **Homepage navigation** - Fixed overlapping elements, now properly spaced like on.com
3. **API fixes** - Removed duplicate `getPropertyById` method that was causing build errors
4. **Image handling** - Enhanced to check multiple field names from VaultRE API

## Technical Setup
- **Framework**: Next.js 13.5.11 with App Router
- **Styling**: Inline styles + CSS modules + Anima exports
- **API**: VaultRE CRM (credentials in CLAUDE.md)
- **Deployment**: Vercel (auto-deploys from main branch)

## Current State
- Last commit `61b1127` ready to push
- Build was failing due to duplicate method (now fixed)
- Navigation spacing matches on.com
- Search page has modern design with animations

## Immediate Tasks
1. Push the pending commit: `git push origin main`
2. Fix property navigation - check console errors, verify IDs aren't undefined
3. Test on both local and deployed Vercel site
4. Remove debug panels once fixed
5. Ensure property images display correctly

## Key Files
- `/src/app/listings/page.tsx` - Has debug panel and broken navigation
- `/src/app/search/page.tsx` - Newly redesigned with slide-out filters
- `/src/app/property/[id]/page.tsx` - Property detail page that can't be reached
- `/src/services/api.ts` - API integration with VaultRE
- `HANDOVER_DOC_20250908.md` - Detailed technical handover

## Commands
```bash
cd /Users/stuartgrant_mbp13/Library/Mobile\ Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/GEA_website/grantsea-website
npm run dev  # Start development server
# Open http://localhost:3000/listings
# Check browser console for errors
```

The property navigation must be fixed - the site is unusable without it.
