## A brief history
Narre Warren South's development began in earnest during the 1990s as part of Melbourne's planned suburban expansion. Unlike the organic growth of older areas, the suburb was masterplanned from inception, with developers and council working together to create a model residential community. The name reflects its position south of the established Narre Warren township, though it quickly developed its own distinct identity.

The suburb's growth coincided with changing approaches to suburban design, incorporating principles of walkability, community focus, and environmental sustainability. Early developments like Parkhill Estate and Berwick Springs set high standards for integrated planning, featuring curved streets, extensive parklands, and community facilities built alongside homes rather than retrofitted later.

By the early 2000s, Narre Warren South had evolved from greenfield development to established suburb, with mature trees, completed infrastructure, and strong community networks. The opening of Casey Central (originally Fountain Gate) transformed the area into a regional retail hub, cementing Narre Warren South's position as a self-sufficient community rather than a dormitory suburb.
